barebones script to do stuff like the watch utlities in the module ecosystems,
but this just uses a basic loop instead of needing `npm` or `pip`. Working in mixed
up environments means I don't always have one or the other.

**todo**
I would add paramters to this but it's not worth it. Copy it and modify it as needed.
